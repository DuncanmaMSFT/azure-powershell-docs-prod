# Move-AzureDeployment

## SYNOPSIS
Swaps deployments between production and staging.

## SYNTAX

```
Move-AzureDeployment [-ServiceName] <String> [-Profile <AzureProfile>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Move-AzureDeployment** cmdlet swaps the virtual IP addresses of deployments in production and staging environments.
This cmdlet swaps a deployment that currently runs in the staging environment to the production environment, and a deployment that runs in the production environment to the staging environment.
If there is a deployment in the staging environment and no deployment in the production environment, the cmdlet moves the deployment to production.
If there is a deployment in the production environment and no deployment in the staging environment, the cmdlet fails.
